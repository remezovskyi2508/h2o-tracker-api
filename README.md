![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/928a9201-670c-4bdf-a1fe-b070c9707808)

This is the backend for the Water Tracker project, developed as part of a team of 14 developers. The backend is built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB to handle data management and communication with the frontend.

## The backend is responsible for:

- Storing and retrieving users' water consumption data.<br/>
- Calculating daily water consumption goals and tracking fulfillment.<br/>
- Handling user authentication and management.<br/>
- Supporting the API endpoints for the frontend to fetch necessary data.<br/>
## Key Features:
- RESTful API for communication between frontend and backend.<br/>
- MongoDB for data storage (user data, water consumption records, etc.).<br/>
- User authentication and data validation.<br/>
- Scalable architecture for handling multiple users and daily data inputs.<br/>
